# Tanzanian-Water-Pump
Focus on creating and improving a model for the Tanazania Water Pump dataset. The goal is to create a model to predict whether a water pump is functional, non-functional, or needs repair.
The tasks for this project are as follows:

Task 1: Use wrangle function to import training and test data.
Task 2: Split training data into feature matrix X and target vector y.
Task 3: Split training data into training and validation sets.
Task 4: Establish the baseline accuracy score for your dataset.
Task 5: Build model.
Task 6: Calculate the training and validation accuracy score for your model.
Task 7: Plot the confusion matrix for your model.
Task 8: Print the classification report for your model.
Task 9: Identify likely 'non-functional' pumps in the test set.
Task 10: Find likely 'non-functional' pumps serving biggest populations.
Task 11 (stretch goal): Plot pump locations from Task 10.
